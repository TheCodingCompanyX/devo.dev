After comparing the provided design specifications with the implemented code, several significant mismatches and issues have been identified. Below are the major areas that require attention:
 
2. Color Mismatches:
   - Text Colors:
     - Design: For example, `Sport (10)` has a `fillColor: #596780`.
     - Code: The text color is set to ` #3563E9` (`text-[#3563E9]`), which does not match the design. 
   - Checkbox Colors:
     - Design: Checkboxes have `backgroundColor: #FFFFFF` when unchecked and `#000000` when checked.
     - Code: The `Ceklist` and `TickSquare` SVGs are used, but their colors might not dynamically reflect the checked/unchecked states as per design.
   - Recommendation: Ensure that all text and checkbox colors precisely match the design specifications. Use exact color codes from the design for consistency.

3. Font Family Not Specified:
   - Issue: The design specifies the use of `Plus Jakarta Sans`, but the code does not explicitly set this font family.
   - Impact: Without explicitly setting the font family, the application might fall back to default fonts, leading to a discrepancy in typography.
   - Recommendation: Apply the `Plus Jakarta Sans` font family either globally or within the specific components to ensure consistency with the design.

8. Typography Overrides Not Addressed:
   - Design: Includes `characterStyleOverrides` and `styleOverrideTable` for nuanced text styling.
   - Code: Applies uniform text styles without accounting for per-character or partial styling as specified.
   - Impact: This can result in text not displaying with the intended emphasis or differentiation among characters.
   - Recommendation: Implement necessary styles or component structures to handle any character-specific styling as outlined in the design.

9. Responsive Design Considerations:
   - Issue: The design uses fixed absolute positions, whereas the code uses relative layouts without explicit responsiveness.
   - Impact: The UI may not render correctly across different devices or screen sizes.
   - Recommendation: Incorporate responsive design principles, possibly using Tailwind's responsive utilities, to ensure the layout adapts gracefully to various screen dimensions.

10. Potential Naming Inconsistencies:
    - Issue: The `Ceklist` SVG is imported with an uppercase "C", whereas typical naming conventions might differ.
    - Impact: This could lead to confusion or potential errors if naming conventions are not consistently followed.
    - Recommendation: Ensure that component and file names follow consistent conventions to maintain code readability and prevent import/export issues.

---

Summary: While the overall structure of the code aligns with the design's sections (Type, Capacity, Price), there are several critical discrepancies related to styling, layout, and component behavior that need to be addressed to achieve a faithful implementation of the design. Focusing on precise styling, accurate color usage, and layout alignment will bridge the gaps between the design and the current codebase.
