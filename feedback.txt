After reviewing the design and the code, here are the major issues and suggestions for change:

1. Checkbox Icon Mismatch: 
   - The code uses two SVG icons: `TickSquare` for checked checkboxes and `Ceklist` for unchecked ones. Verify that these SVGs match the design's visual representation.

2. Slider Range and Position: 
   - The code's slider bar fills 55% of its width, but the visual design indicate it might be closer to 75%. Check the exact percentage alignments to ensure it matches the design.

3. Color Discrepancies: 
   - The design uses specific colors for text and checkboxes. Ensure that colors like `text-gray-600` and `text-gray-400` match the colors in the design.
   - The highlighted selection color is blue in the design. Ensure that it uses the correct blue shade.

If these areas are aligned and adjusted accordingly in your code, it should be a good match with the design specifications.
